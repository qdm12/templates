# VSCode

## Extensions

Most extensions I use are in my VSCode development containers already so are not mentioned in this document.

However, some extensions are useful occasionally and not present in my usual development containers configurations:

- `GrapeCity.gc-excelviewer`
- `ms-vscode.github-issues-prs`
- `ms-vscode.powershell`
- `ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare` Live share your vs code
- `pnp.polacode` Take screenshots
- `softwaredotcom.swdc-vscode` Code time
- `tomoki1207.pdf` view PDFs
- `yzane.markdown-pdf` markdown to PDFs
